# Sigma-Rule-Repository
Sigma-Rule-Repository is a collection of detection rules in Sigma Format. In contrast to other Sigma repositories, this repository contains for every detection rule a testing documentation. The detection rules are sorted based on the [Mitre ATT&CK Techniques](https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/).

## Sigma
